Apple Trailer Viewer
====================

Apple Trailer Viewer is a HTML5/JS sample application that I built to play with the latest and greatest tools for modern web application development.

The original version of this app was created in 2010 in a day using [Adobe Flex][1] 4.1 as a request for a code sample for a UI Developer position, which, I think, sealed the deal (well, that, and my perspicacity and gregarious personality). However, now that "Flash [isn't][2] [cool][3] [anymore][4]" (except, maybe, in [sweden][5]), I've *begrudgingly* started playing with HTML5/JS so that I can be cool again, which is the most important thing to me *IN THE WORLD*.
