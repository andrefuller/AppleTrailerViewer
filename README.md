Apple Trailer Viewer
====================

Apple Trailer Viewer is a HTML5/JS sample application that I built to play with the latest and greatest tools for modern web application development.

The original version of this app was created in 2010 in a day using [Adobe Flex][1] 4.1 as a request for a code sample for a UI Developer position, which, I think, sealed the deal (well, that, and my perspicacity and gregarious personality). However, now that "Flash [isn't][2] [cool][3] [anymore][4]" (except, maybe, in [sweden][5]), I've *begrudgingly* started playing with HTML5/JS so that I can be cool again, which is the most important thing to me *IN THE WORLD*.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js][6] (at or above 0.12.x), used to run JavaScript tools from the command line.
- npm, the node package manager, installed with Node.js and used to install Node.js packages.

To get the app up and running you need to:
### 1. Get the code

Clone this repo (or otherwise download) to a directory of your choosing.

### 2. Install dependencies

With Node.js installed, run the following one liner from the root of your Apple Trailer Viewer download:

```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Build and launch

```sh
npm start
```
